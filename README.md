# Zaplish Core

Zaplish Core is the foundation of the [Zaplish CMS](https://github.com/zaplish/zaplish) – providing the admin panel, content engine, configuration system, and API layer for Laravel-based sites and apps.

This package is not a standalone CMS.  
It’s designed to be installed as a Composer dependency inside a Laravel project (for example, `zaplish/zaplish`.

---

## Installation

Zaplish Core is not intended to be installed directly.

To start a new project with Zaplish CMS, use the official installer package instead:

```bash
composer create-project zaplish/zaplish mysite
```
